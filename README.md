### hestmotion.m : Matlab wrapper for an MRI image/volume coregistration method by [David Heeger (NYU)](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/heegerlab/?page=home).
My main addition is the iteration over MRI volumes in a 4D dataset for the purpose of fMRI motion correction.

The original code was forked from: http://www.cns.nyu.edu/heegerlab/content/software/imgregsoft/registration.tar

Thanks for sharing!
