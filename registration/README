Code in this directory implements 2D and 3D versions of multiscale
affine and rigid (rotation and translation) image registration, like
that described by Bergen et al., "Hierarchical model-based motion
estimation" in Proceedings of Second European Conference on Computer
Vision, Springer-Verlag, p. 237-252, 1992.

motion.ps provides a detailed description of the algorithm (and
related approaches).

A good place to start is by looking at the examples near the bottom of
estMotionMulti2.m and estMotionMulti3.m.
